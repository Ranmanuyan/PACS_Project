Here you will find different programs for testing Branch and Bound with 
different programming environment of Bob++.

seq.cpp, thr.cpp and atha.cpp are the same Branch and Bound simulation.
In fact the subproblems are generated randomly.

To see the possible Bob++ parameters simply type <program> -help.
To see the possible Kaapi/Athapascan parameter simply execute <program> --help

./bbatha --community -thread.poolsize 2 -ps.enable -term.period 2000
executes the simulation with 2 threads. This is interesting on a SMP machine.

mip.cpp is an implementation of a real Branch and Bound solving a linear
program with in a lp format.  The file roy.lp is an example of one of these.
This exemple also shows how to have one source code to generate 2 executables 
i.e. mipseq and mipthr.
